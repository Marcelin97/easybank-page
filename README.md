# Easybank landing page

## This challenge will provide a nice test for your layout skills. If you're ready to move up from Junior challenges, this one is a great next step.

## BRIEF
> Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

> You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

> The only JavaScript required is for the mobile navigation toggle. However, you could also try doing this without JS.

> Your users should be able to:

> View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
> See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
> Download the starter code and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project. The style-guide.md file is where you'll find colors, fonts, etc.
